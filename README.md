üöó OLA Mobility: Operations & Insights Dashboard

An interactive and comprehensive data dashboard designed to monitor and analyze key performance indicators for OLA's ride-hailing operations. The dashboard provides a holistic view of bookings, revenue, cancellations, and ratings across various vehicle types.

The OLA Mobility Dashboard is a dynamic Power BI report that gives stakeholders a real-time view of the platform‚Äôs performance. Its purpose is to help business leaders, operations managers, and data analysts understand trends in ride bookings, revenue generation, and customer/driver behavior, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize the service.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì The primary data visualization platform used to create the interactive report.

üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preparing the raw operational data.

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used to create calculated measures, such as Cancellation Rate, Total Booking Value, and Average Distance Travelled.

üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables to enable seamless cross-filtering and aggregation of data, for example, linking bookings to vehicle types and ratings.

üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

Source

Sample OLA data extracted from an Excel file provided via a website. The data includes detailed records of every booking, including the date, time, vehicle type, payment method, booking status (Success, Cancelled by Driver/Customer, Driver Not Found), booking value, distance, and associated driver and customer ratings.

Business Problem

In a fast-paced and highly competitive market like ride-hailing, OLA needs a single source of truth to monitor its operational health.
Key questions such as: "What is our current cancellation rate and why are rides being cancelled?", "Which vehicle type generates the most revenue?", and "How are our drivers and customers rating each other?" are difficult to answer without a unified and interactive reporting tool. Without this, it's challenging to identify bottlenecks, optimize fleet allocation, and improve the overall user experience.

Goal of the Dashboard

  i) To provide a centralized, interactive tool for monitoring and managing OLA's business performance.

  ii) To quickly uncover key trends and operational inefficiencies, such as high cancellation rates in specific categories or for certain        reasons.

  iii) To support strategic decisions related to revenue optimization, fleet management, and improving service quality.
